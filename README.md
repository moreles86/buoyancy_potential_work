# buoyancy_potential_work
A R script that calculates the buoyancy work required to bring a parcel of water from different depths (zint) to a reference depth (z2=-10 m). 
It is considered a resting ocean and that the plot in zint is in hydrostatic equilibrium. 
The vertical discretization of the vertical profile can be non-equidistant.
